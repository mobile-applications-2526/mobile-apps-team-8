# backend

You can find the backend in /craftmanship, however it does not need to be ran since the backend is already hosted online.

# build

You can find a zipped apk (file was too large for github push) in /build, you just have to unzip it and install it on an android device and it should work.
You can also run dev mode with `npm start` and that will give you the default expo qr code to use in their app.
